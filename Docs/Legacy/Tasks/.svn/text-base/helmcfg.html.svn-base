<H2>Description</H2>
The helm is a pretty important process in the MOOS suite. Of course it isn't 
critical but it provides a single process in which navigational information
is processed and decisions made on what physical motion should occur in the light of that 
information. For example it might simply control elevator angle as a function
of raw depth sensor reading or in a different script it would peruse output
of a CML algorithm and steer a course to an "interesting location".
<p>
The helm itself acts under the influence of any number of prioritised 
tasks that it runs in parralel. This fact directs the reader to the individual
task documentation to get a thorough understanding of the macroscopic operation
of teh helm process. However some parameters are generic to all tasks and can be
set withing the helm configuration block.
